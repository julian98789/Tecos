# 🌮 Tecos Restaurant 🍽️

## Description

This is my first project using Next.js, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS. As a database manager, I use MySQL. This project consists of developing a website for the fictional restaurant "Tecos," dedicated to offering Mexican cuisine.

### Key Features:

- **Online Menu**: 📜 Customers can browse our complete menu, with detailed descriptions of each dish, its image, and updated prices.
  
- **Select Table**: 🪑 We provide table-shaped buttons with which customers can select their table, and their order will be automatically redirected to the selected table.

- **Table Status**: 🚪 When the customer selects the table they are sitting at, that table will be disabled and cannot be selected.

- **Online Ordering**: 📲 Customers can place their order through the website, and the order will be sent to the cashier, who can then invoice it.

- **Invoicing**: 🧾 The cashier can generate an invoice for the customer's order in PDF format.

## Technologies Used:

- **Next.js**: Used to develop the frontend of the web application and to integrate the JavaScript runtime environment on the server-side, allowing me to develop both frontend and backend with a single language and framework.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Used to style and design the user interface of the application.

- **Node.js**: For backend development.

- **MySQL**: For storing and managing application data.
